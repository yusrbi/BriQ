# BriQ
Bridging Quantities in Tables and Text.

We present the  BriQ system that targets quantity alignment problem:
bidirectional linking between textual mentions of quantities and the corresponding table cells, in order to support
advanced content summarization and faster navigation between explanations in text and details in tables.

BriQ is designed to cope with the specific challenges of approximate quantities, aggregated quantities, and calculated quantities in text that are common but cannot be directly
matched in table cells. We judiciously combine feature-based classification with joint inference by random walks over candidate
alignment graphs. Experiments with a large collection of tables from the Common Crawl project 
demonstrate the viability of our methods.
